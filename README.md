# SQL Injection Demonstration & Prevention Report

This repository contains a coursework report titled **"Security in Computing"** as part of module **CC5004NI**. The report demonstrates SQL Injection attacks using SQLMap on a vulnerable web application hosted in Kali Linux, and discusses preventative measures for web security.

## 📄 Report Overview

- **Tool Used:** SQLMap, Kali Linux, VMware Workstation, Acunetix
- **Attack Type:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Objective:** Extract sensitive data (e.g., usernames, passwords) and demonstrate vulnerability exploitation on a test environment.
- **Prevention:** Secure coding practices, input sanitization, WAF usage, etc.
- **Extras:** Cost-Benefit Analysis, Pros & Cons of SQLi exploitation and mitigation

## 🧰 Tools & Environment

- Kali Linux (Penetration Testing)
- SQLMap (SQL Injection Tool)
- Acunetix (Vulnerability Scanner)
- VMware Workstation (Virtualization)

## 📊 Figures Included
